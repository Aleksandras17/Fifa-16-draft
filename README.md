Fun project for personal use made so I have complete control over probabilities while making a draft on fifa 16. All of the weights and intervals are hardcoded which is not perfect, however, since this is for personal use, there is no problem with rewriting the code if needed.
Planned for it to have a front end as well, which I have not done, but its fully functional and has been used on multiple occasions


Scrapper file - python code used to scrape html code to gather necessary information. Was originaly planned to scrape straight from a website, but the website was blocking requests. Had to manually download the html code of needed pages to use.

Fifa 16 projcet - the main part was made using java, since, that was the language I was learning at the moment. The randomise class uses a csv file with player information, made with the included scrapper. The fix positions class is used to simplify the names of positions to my liking, a process needed to switch rare positions (for example - right wing back) to more common ones (like right back), making it easier to use the randomise class. The FixPos class uses a player.csv file which is not yet fixed, so it has not been included.
